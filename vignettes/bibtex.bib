  abstract = "We previously piloted the concept of a Connectivity Map (CMap),
              whereby genes, drugs, and disease states are connected by virtue
              of common gene-expression signatures. Here, we report more than a
              1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS
              Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput
              reduced representation expression profiling method that we term
              L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to
              RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the
              expression levels of 81\% of non-measured transcripts. We further
              show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of
              action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants
              of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million
              L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their
              analysis, are available at https://clue.io.",

              chemicals and physiological processes, and diseases and drugs.
              These results indicate the feasibility of the approach and

              comprehensive molecular information about drugs, their
              mechanisms, their interactions and their targets. First described
              in 2006, DrugBank has continued to evolve over the past 12 years
              in response to marked improvements to web standards and changing
              needs for drug research and development. This year's update,
              DrugBank 5.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the
              database in more than 10 years. In many cases, existing data
              content has grown by 100\% or more over the last update. For
              instance, the total number of investigational drugs in the
              database has grown by almost 300\%, the number of drug-drug
              interactions has grown by nearly 600\% and the number of
              SNP-associated drug effects has grown more than 3000\%.
              Significant improvements have been made to the quantity, quality
              and consistency of drug indications, drug binding data as well as
              drug-drug and drug-food interactions. A great deal of brand new
              data have also been added to DrugBank 5.0. This includes
              information on the influence of hundreds of drugs on metabolite
              levels (pharmacometabolomics), gene expression levels
              (pharmacotranscriptomics) and protein expression levels
              (pharmacoprotoemics). New data have also been added on the status
              of hundreds of new drug clinical trials and existing drug
              repurposing trials. Many other important improvements in the
              content, interface and performance of the DrugBank website have
              been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use,
              utility and potential applications in many areas of
